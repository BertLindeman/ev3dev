** Does ev3dev replace the firmware on my EV3 programmable brick? **

No. ev3dev runs completely off of a SD card, leaving the existing firmware intact. To restore the original functionality of your brick, just power it off and remove the SD card containing ev3dev. When you turn it back on, it will boot using the existing firmware.
