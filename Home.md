Watch this space for more detailed instructions than those in the individual README.md files in the repository.

Let's get started - every new article gets added to the top of this list - when there's enough we'll start to categorize them.

### Getting Started

- [Writing A microSD Card](https://github.com/mindboards/ev3dev/wiki/Writing-A-microSD-Card)

The easiest way to get started with `ev3dev` hacking is to use USB/Ethernet networking so that you can `ssh` directly to the brick without the need for a wifi conenction.

We're assuming that you've got:

1. A [microSD card with the `ev3dev` image](https://github.com/mindboards/ev3dev/wiki/Writing-A-microSD-Card) loaded
2. The USB cable that comes with the EV3
3. A Linux/OSX/Windows host computer/tablet with a free host USB port
4. The `ev3dev.rc.local` file on the FAT32 partition of the microSD card configured for your host machine.

Connect the USB-mini end of the cable to the EV3, and leave the host end disconnected from your computer for now. Then boot the EV3. When you see the `ev3dev` signon logo on the LCD, you know that the EV3 is ready to communicate with your host machine.
